## Features

This template is created using Python 3.8, and includes the following features.

- [Pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/): framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

- [Mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/): optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or "duck") typing and static typing.

- [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/): wrapper around PyFlakes and pycodestyle.

- [Bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/): tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.

- [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire): library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.
